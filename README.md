# Employment-Now---An-analysis-on-improving-unemployment-in-NYC-Boroughs

# Background: 

Employment Now! Is a Back to Work program contracted by the Human Resource
Administration (HRA) of NY State to assist candidates enrolled in Public Assistance in finding and
retaining employment. Their services include resume writing, interview training, and free interview attire.
Once prepared, participants will work closely with case workers who refer them for interviews.


# The Task: 

1. To analyze the data to understand the previous performance of the
Employment Now! Program, focusing exclusively on New York City boroughs, and to make
recommendations for future directions that will help participants back into employment as we move
into a new recession. 
2. Present insights to highlight Employment Now! performance in its key tasks and
objectives. Consider adding references to macro economic data if it is relevant to your narrative (e.g.
relevant unemployment data about NYC during the time the program was in effect, employment by job
sector in NYC, or other relevant data)
